  "articleBody": "Why is the blog called “Trident”?\nThere’s a concept of the ‘CIA Triad’ - Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability as the cornerstones of cybersecurity. This blog is me weaponizing the information I’ve learned over my life in both red team and blue team experience. I’m turning the CIA Triad into a Trident. If the gum company wants to sponsor me, contact information is below.\nWhy should we read anything you post?\nYou shouldn’t, I exist in a perpetual state of not knowing enough but if you gain any insight from following then that’s a net positive. Pretty much everything I post I hope I get feedback that tells me I’m wrong so I can do it better in the future.\nWho are you?\nOver twenty years in the IT industry from lowly tech to cybersecurity professional. Inspired by 2600 Magazine, movies like Hackers and Operation Takedown I’ve always been fascinated with computers and the internet. As a kid all the wrong parts came naturally to me - breaking America Online (both the software, and their staff), creating integrated third party apps with various nefarious intentions. As I got a bit older I stopped that type of behavior as I knew I was not mature enough to handle it and the risk of being charged as an adult wasn’t worth it - being a kid in high school took precedence over online activities.\nI followed a career in support and operations - transformed a computer shop that used paper on clipboard tracking system with some block hour business clients into a modern managed service provider. Quickly moved from hardware repairs to network support and eventually full site architecture and service. I aligned to industry best practices and provided all levels of support for medical clients with critical emergency needs. Navigated the waters of C-Level management communication and expectations, pain points with vendors and built unique solutions for many line of business application challenges.\nAs I moved on to larger scale MSP challenges and career opportunities the day to day grind of operations was wearing thin and I was no longer feeling inspired by the work. As the opportunity came up I decided to pivot to a more security-focused role and have since completely focused on tackling cybersecurity challenges for organizations of all sizes. Back to where it all started in a way, with the maturity and respect the profession deserves.\nI feel the diversity of environments I’ve worked in gives me unique insight into the cybersecurity landscape. Hopefully that leads to some worthwhile content here.\nCertifications: Linux+, Sec+, CySA+, Cisco CCNA (Expired) E-mail: brett@dreher.ai\n",
